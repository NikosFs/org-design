### You

We like people who do the best they can, whilst behaving decently along the way.

You will consider yourself a T-shaped individual that can lead a delivery whilst serving within a team.

You like to foster a great team culture and thrive inside that team as an egoless peer

You share problems, as well as victories and understand that fostering an environment of openness, transparency and fairness is the best way to keep a customer satisfied, and deliver disruptive innovation.

You optimise at the value chain level rather than sub-optimise at the component level and focus on the outcome rather than the output

You use the Agile Manifesto as your guiding principle across all areas of Digital Transformation. You understand that the principles arenâ€™t development specific.

You encourage yourself and the team to use the right tool for the job. You are not wedded to technologies or techniques and understand that the loose coupling and high cohesion is a principal that can equally applied to team dynamics as well as software development.

You derive your satisfaction from the success of the whole over the success of the one. You are happy working in an entirely flat structure where everyone is there peer. When leadership is required a Buildit Delivery person will lead from a position of trust and respect, the team will follow because they want to not because they have to.

You understand to truly transform companies they need to be confident enough to be a client's critical friend. You will help them to see when they are making ill informed decisions or focusing their time in the wrong areas. You do this with tact and diplomacy but also openness and fairness that will prioritise long term relationships over short term appeasement. 

You constantly ask yourself whether you are attached to an idea or concept, and if you are whether that is inhibiting your ability to consider the alternatives.
