### Constructing a Job Spec Guide

Generally try to put together the branded job spec's in the following format

1. *Why us, Why you* - shared text for all job spec's
2. *You* - this should be tailored at the tribe level
3. *Skills & Experience* - this should be tailored at the tribe and experience level 
4. *Conclusion* - shared text for all job spec's 

The exception is a generic job spec for a website or silicon milk roundabout type of event. Where we want to use it as a catch all. A more generic *You* should be used and skills and experience can most likely be omitted.
