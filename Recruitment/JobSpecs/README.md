### Constructing a Job Spec Guide

Our job specs are meant to be an invitation to a conversation with people who may want to work with us. The goal is to paint a picture of who we are, and leave a space that people can put themselves into, if they fit. We do not want a traditional job spec. We want the job spec to encourage self-selection by candidates, with a big emphasis on culture, right out the door. The better the job spec filters people, the less filtering we have to do manually, later, and therefore the more time and energy we save.

Generally try to put together the branded job spec's in the following format

1. *Why would you join us?* - shared text for all job spec's
2. *Why You?* - this should be tailored at the tribe level
4. *Conclusion* - shared text for all job spec's

The exception is a generic job spec for a website or silicon milk roundabout type of event. Where we want to use it as a catch all. A more generic *Why You* should be used.
