###Finally...

Technology moves, the competition moves, the market moves, the people move. We love that complexity – we think it’s where really interesting challenges come from, which require the ability to see both detail and the bigger picture. Success in an ever-changing world requires experimentation and learning; experimentation and learning require autonomy. Autonomy rocks.

The future belongs to those who understand that it’s not about system specification but end-user expectation. The future belongs to those who design and build it. The future belongs to those who make it.
