###Who we are
Buildit is a transformation studio. We are a company that helps create better companies. We partner with our clients to build innovative product-service experiences, and help high calibre development teams to scale independently.

###What we do
In a constantly evolving world, Buildit helps make the future. We are a hands-on partner that cares about the detail, and understands how to innovate:

* Leverage world class design capabilities, via Designit
* Form teams of change makers
* Host those teams in a highly collaborative studio environment
* Combine customer centricity with high calibre engineering
* Value 'doing the right things' as much as 'doing things right'

###Why us?
Do you think there’s something wrong with the way most companies approach problems, whether they’re people, process, or technology related?

Do you want to help them figure out how to think differently?

Do you love technology, but understand that real change comes from people doing things differently, rather than people doing the same things differently?

We’re looking for people who want to help us change the way companies think and approach problems; people who want to work with teams and individuals who share a passion for solving complex problems; people who want to own the entire problem, whether it’s about technology, ways of working, teams, or poor customer experience.

We’re looking for people who want to be treated like adults – who neither need, nor want, someone else to tell them what needs to be done, but instead who can look at what’s happening, what’s needed, and figure out how they fit into it. We’re looking for people who are comfortable finding their own place.

We’re looking for people who are willing to seek input when they want to make a decision that will affect others, or when others know more than they do.

We build software. We build teams. We build new ways of working. We build better organisations.
