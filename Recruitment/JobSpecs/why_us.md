Do you think there’s something lacking in how many companies approach problems, whether they’re people, process, or technology related?

Do you want to help them figure out how to think and work differently?

Do you love technology, and understand that real change comes from people doing things differently, rather than people doing the same things differently?

If these are things that drive you, then we may want to talk to you.

Buildit is a transformation studio, a company that helps build better companies. We partner with clients to create new products and services, and help their teams scale independently. Our clients know that there's a better way to deliver software, but aren't always sure what it is, or how to get there. We understand that organisational transformation is a journey and not a single event. When they are ready to change, we help them.

We are not a consultancy, and not an outsourcer. We are a hands-on partner that participates and cares about the detail, and we recognise that real change comes from people doing things differently. The Buildit team invests significantly with every client we work with, focusing on getting things done and helping prove a method and a model to unlock future speed and scale. We specialise in customer centricity and high calibre engineering.

We have done this before, transforming large organisations with millions of users. And now we’re applying what we’ve learned to help create the next generation of business.


### Our approach
We hunger to change the way companies think and approach problems. We are genuinely curious about business, UX, strategy, social and behavioural factors. We enjoy owning the entire problem, whether it’s about technology, ways of working, teams, or poor customer experience. We appreciate that engineering is a key piece of a bigger puzzle, understanding the other pieces and ‘the whole’. We enjoy finding ways to make complicated tasks easy, eliminating things that aren’t valuable and automating things that are.

We work as cross-functional teams that share a passion for solving complex problems. Our colleagues are egoless peers that enjoy listening, learning, and sharing as part of a flat organisation. They are polyglots who enjoy looking at what’s happening, what’s needed, and figure out how they fit into it. They seek input when they want to make a decision that will affect others, or when others know more than they do. They can often be heard saying “it’s good enough” and “let’s ship it”, but also “what is our goal?” and “this should be nowhere near production”. We encourage everyone to bring their personality to work.

We provide dedicated time and support for you to own your own development and growth. We ensure each individual has the space they need to turn their ideas and suggestions into reality where it can be valued and promoted by our community. It’s important for us to have a publicly recognised, authentic voice and for you to have your voice heard inside and outside of Buildit.

We build software. We build teams. We build new ways of working. We build better organisations.
