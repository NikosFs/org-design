Buildit is a transformation studio, a company that helps create better companies. We partner with clients to build new products and services, and help their teams scale independently. Our clients know that there's a better way to deliver software, but aren't always sure what it is, or how to get there. We understand that organisational transformation is a journey and not a single event. When they are ready to change, we help them.

We are not a consultancy, and not an outsourcer. We are a hands-on partner that participates and cares about the detail. We recognise that real change comes from people doing things differently, rather than people doing the same things differently. The Buildit team invests significantly with every client we work with, focusing on getting things done and helping prove a method and a model to unlock future speed and scale. We specialise in customer centricity, high calibre engineering and flow.

We have done this before, transforming large organisations with millions of users. And now we’re applying what we’ve learned to help create the next generation of business.


### Our approach
We are looking for people who want to help us change the way companies think and approach problems; people who want to work as individuals and cross-functional teams, who share a passion for solving complex problems; people who want to own the entire problem, whether it’s about technology, ways of working, teams, or poor customer experience.

We are value polygots who neither need, nor want, to be told what needs to be done, but instead who can look at what’s happening, what’s needed, and figure out how they fit into it. We’re looking for people who are comfortable finding their own place in a flat organisation amongst egoless peers who are willing to listen, learn, and share.

We are genuinely curious about business, UX, strategy, social and behavioural factors and appreciate that engineering is a key piece of a bigger puzzle, understanding the other pieces and ‘the whole’. We enjoy finding ways to make complicated tasks easy, elminating things that aren’t valuable and automating things that are. We can often be heard saying “it’s good enough” and “let’s ship it”, but also “what is our goal?” and “this should be nowhere near production”. We encourage everyone to bring their personality to work and to seek input when they want to make a decision that will affect others, or when others know more than they do.

We provide dedicated time and support for you to own your own development and growth. We provide you the space to turn your ideas and suggestions into reality and your contributions to our community will be valued and promoted. It’s important for us to have a publicly recognised, authentic voice and for you to have your voice heard inside and outside of Buildit.

We build software. We build teams. We build new ways of working. We build better organisations.
