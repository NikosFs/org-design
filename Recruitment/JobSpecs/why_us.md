Do you think there’s something lacking in how many companies approach problems, whether they’re people, process, or technology related?

Do you want to help them figure out how to think and work differently?

Do you love technology, and understand that real change comes from people doing things differently, rather than people doing the same things differently?

If these are things that drive you, then we may want to talk to you.


### Our approach
We hunger to change the way companies think and approach problems. We are genuinely curious about business, UX, strategy, social and behavioural factors. We enjoy owning the entire problem, whether it’s about technology, ways of working, teams, or poor customer experience. We appreciate that engineering is a key piece of a bigger puzzle, understanding the other pieces and ‘the whole’. We enjoy finding ways to make complicated tasks easy, eliminating things that aren’t valuable and automating things that are.

We work as cross-functional teams that share a passion for solving complex problems. Our colleagues are egoless peers that enjoy listening, learning, and sharing as part of a flat organisation. They are polyglots who enjoy looking at what’s happening, what’s needed, and figure out how they fit into it. They seek input when they want to make a decision that will affect others, or when others know more than they do. They can often be heard saying “it’s good enough” and “let’s ship it”, but also “what is our goal?” and “this should be nowhere near production”. We encourage everyone to bring their personality to work.

We provide dedicated time and support for you to own your own development and growth. We ensure each individual has the space they need to turn their ideas and suggestions into reality where it can be valued and promoted by our community. It’s important for us to have a publicly recognised, authentic voice and for you to have your voice heard inside and outside of Buildit.

We build software. We build teams. We build new ways of working. We build better organisations.
