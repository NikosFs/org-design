### Why You?

Our clients deliver traditional software in traditional ways. They know there's a better way to do things, but aren't always sure what it is, or how to get there. When they are ready to change, we help them. Would you like to help?

Would you describe yourself as a T-shaped individual, that can wear many hats and that can lead a delivery whilst serving within a team? 

Would you enjoy fostering a great team culture and thrive inside that team as an egoless peer? 

Can you derive your satisfaction from the success of the whole over the success of the one? 

Are you happy working in an entirely flat structure where everyone is your peer? 

Do you cherish emergent leadership and seek out every opportunity to remove impediments to delivery?

Do you share problems, as well as victories and believe that fostering an environment of openness, transparency and fairness is the best way to keep a customer satisfied, and deliver disruptive innovation?

Do you encourage those around you to focus on optimising the whole rather than parts? Do you value the outcome over than the output?

Do you use the Agile Manifesto as your guiding principle across all areas of transformation? Do you believe that the principles arenâ€™t development specific?

Can you encourage yourself and the team to use the right tool for the job? Do you try not to get wedded to technologies or techniques and believe that the loose coupling and high cohesion is a principal that can equally applied to team dynamics as well as software development?

Do you believe to truly transform companies you need to be confident enough to be a client's critical friend and help them to think differently? Can you help them to see when they are making ill informed decisions or focusing their time on the wrong things? Can you do this with tact and diplomacy but also openness and fairness that will prioritise long term relationships over short term appeasement? 

Do you constantly ask yourself whether you are attached to an idea or concept, and if you are whether that is inhibiting your ability to consider the alternatives?
