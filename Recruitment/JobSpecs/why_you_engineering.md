### What you'll do
* Work intimately with clients to understand their organisation, aspirations and challenges.
* Help clients identify promising solutions through participating in, and leading, digital workshops.
* Build real solutions through experimentation as part of a multi-faceted team.  
* Accelerate and improve how we help our clients through developing and contributing to components, services and methodologies.
* Explore up-and-coming technologies and software products; seize learning and knowledge sharing opportunities; participate in professional organizations. Read; teach; learn.


### What we value
* Do you enjoy down-and-dirty, hands-on, best-of-breed software engineering, within autonomous, cross-functional delivery teams?
* Are you excited about cloud-first, full-stack development, with deep experience in at least one ubiquitous programming language and polyglot tendencies?
* Do you have experience across a broad range of languages and tools, and are you able to make the appropriate selection when approaching both new and existing projects?
* Are you passionate about introducing the freedom of lean start-up engineering practices into companies that only know big and slow?
* Do you care deeply about educating and guiding teams and clients into enlightened software delivery?
* Are you all about solutions and being pragmatic, and able to cut through noise and nonsense in an approachable and sensitive manner?
* Are you able to challenge ways of thinking and working without being perceived as an arrogant know-it-all? Can you balance compromise against ideals?
* Are you comfortable having conversations spanning deep technical implementation to high-level architecture, and organisational transformation to team building?
