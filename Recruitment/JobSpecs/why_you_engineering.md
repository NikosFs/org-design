### Why You?

Our clients know that there's a better way to deliver software, but aren't always sure what it is, or how to get there. When they are ready to change, we help them.

If that sounds like something you'd like to be a part of, here are some things to consider:

* Are you looking for a team that operates with a flat hierarchy, and that's made up of egoless peers who are willing to listen, learn, and share? Does the idea of being able to be yourself at work appeal to you?

* Do you enjoy down-and-dirty, hands-on, best-of-breed software engineering, within autonomous, cross-functional delivery teams?

* Are you excited about cloud-first, full-stack development, with deep experience in at least one ubiquitous programming language and polyglot tendencies?

* Do you have experience across a broad range of languages and tools, and are you able to make the appropriate selection when approaching both new and existing projects?

* Are you passionate about introducing the freedom of lean start-up engineering practices into companies that only know big and slow?

* Do you care deeply about educating and guiding teams and clients into enlightened software delivery?

* Are you all about solutions and being pragmatic, and able to cut through noise and nonsense in an approachable and sensitive manner?

* Are you able to challenge ways of thinking and working without being perceived as an arrogant know-it-all? Can you balance compromise against ideals?

* Are you comfortable having conversations spanning deep technical implementation to high-level architecture, and organisational transformation to team building?

* Do you understand that organisational transformation is a journey and not a single event?


If this sounds like you, or something that you want to grow into, we'd love to chat to you!
