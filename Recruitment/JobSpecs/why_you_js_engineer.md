### Why You?

Our clients know that there's a better way to deliver software, but aren't always sure what it is, or how to get there. When they are ready to change, we help them.

If that sounds like something you'd like to be a part of, here are some things to consider:

#### The Responsibilities:

* Working with the Engineering, Business Strategy, UX/UI and Design teams as well as customer organizations to architect, design, and implement solutions.
* Designing, developing and productising front-end components and services that complete our Digital Rig – a fully automated platform and continuous delivery stack we use to bootstrap and accelerate Customer Journey Engineering.
* Determine, apply and improve appropriate methodologies and toolsets for a customer’s culture and operating environment.
* Participate in and lead digital workshops with customer organizations.
* Complete solutions by coordinating, communicating, and contributing to team meetings and customer engagements.
* Explore up-and-coming technologies and software products; seize learning and knowledge sharing opportunities; maintain personal networks; participate in professional organizations. Read; teach; learn.
* Enhance the group’s reputation by accepting ownership for accomplishing new and different requests; exploring opportunities to add value.
* Support the team by providing advice, coaching, and educational opportunities.

#### You:

* Are a talented and passionate Javascript Engineer, handling both server-side and client-side code.
* Are looking for a team that operates with a flat hierarchy, and that's made up of egoless peers who are willing to listen, learn, and share.
* Can bring you natural personality to work.
* Are a self-starter and a pragmatist, able to balance quality, delivery, and focus, as well as an excellent communicator with a hands-on approach to business.
* Have excellent ES2016/ESNext/HTML/CSS skills and can use modern frameworks to develop single page applications.
* Have experience across a broad range of languages and tools, and are able to make the appropriate selection when approaching both new and existing projects.
* Are keen to learn and keep up with new technologies. However, your depth of understanding transcends current crazes and trendy tools/frameworks.
* Can work effectively with UX/designers to build exciting UIs for web applications.
* Are genuinely curious about business, UX, strategy, social and behavioural factors.
* Have a deep understanding of what motivates, inspires and stifles software teams.
* Appreciate that engineering is a key piece of a bigger puzzle. You understand the other pieces and ‘the whole’.
* Take ownership. You don’t need to be told what to do. You do seek feedback and are inclusive.
* Find ways to make complicated tasks easy. You take pride in eliminating things that aren’t valuable and automate things that are.
* Have put your faith in agile methods and practices, found their limitations, found ways to overcome them.
* Are comfortable working with uncertainty. You can tackle constraints and work around them.
* Hold and express considered opinions, and modify them when faced with contrary evidence. Above all, you let the facts do the talking whenever possible.
* Have been heard saying “it’s good enough” and “let’s ship it”, but also “what is our goal?” and “this should be nowhere near production”.
* Are a student. You’re a teacher. You always seek a better way. You want to become or are a master of your craft.
* Do what it takes to ensure a successful outcome, knowing when to compromise and when not to.
* Have strong critical thinking and trouble-shooting skills.
* Are highly accountable for meeting all commitments and deadlines
* Demonstrate effective communication skills, both written and verbal for technical and non-technical audiences.
